# CPP-Final-Project---Text-Based-Adventure-Game

A short text based adventure game. I was inspired by the ones on homestarrunner.com. Player must navigate the dungeon and enter commands to solve the puzzle and find the exit.

Running the Program
Requirements

A C++ compiler (such as g++, Visual Studio, or Code::Blocks).

The source files of the project, including any header files.

Steps

Open your terminal or IDE.
Navigate to the folder containing the project source files.

Compile the program.
Use your C++ compiler to build the executable. For example, with g++, you would compile like this:

g++ -o adventure main.cpp other_files.cpp

You can also just press the green arrow. Usually. !!!

This will create an executable named adventure (or adventure.exe on Windows).

Run the program.
Execute the compiled program:

On Windows: double-click adventure.exe or run it in the command prompt.

On Linux/macOS: type ./adventure in the terminal.

Play the game.

Type commands in the console to interact:

GO <direction> to move.

LOOK to see your surroundings.

LOOK <feature> to examine something specific.

GET <item> to pick up an item.

USE <item> <direction> to interact with objects or unlock doors.

INVENTORY to see the items you’re carrying.

Winning the game.
Find your way to Room 9 to complete the dungeon and win.
